A business owner is unhappy with the services provided by the government and has chosen to pay the tax using a combination of coins including quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennis. In this project, you are asked to write a program to analyze the tax payment in coins. The program first asks for the number of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies the owner has paid. It then computes the total amount of tax paid in dollars and centsm and computers the weight of all the coins in pounds. Next assume the same amount of tax will be paid using paper bills in the following denominations: $20 bills, $10 bills, $5 bills, and $1 bills.(If the tax amount contains any cents, round it to the nearest dollar.) The program will figure out how to pay the tax with the minimal number of bills(therefore the minimal weight), and compute the weight of these bills in both grams and pounds.
